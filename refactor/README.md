### What Makes It Amazing:
        The code is now more organized and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (S in SOLID).
        Dependencies are injected through the constructor, following Dependency Injection (D in SOLID).

###    What Makes It Okay:
        The use of the response helper directly might be okay, but consider using Laravel's response macros for consistency and reusability.

###    What Makes It Terrible:
        The code could benefit from more detailed comments within the methods, especially for complex logic or where business rules are applied.
        The use of env() directly in conditions might be okay but consider extracting it to a variable for better readability.
